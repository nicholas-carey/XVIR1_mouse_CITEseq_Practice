# CITE-Seq Analysis Practice

This repository contains code from my CITE-Seq analysis practice. It will only contain the Rmd file I use after automated-preprocessing and the yml file I used to submit my automated preprocessing. All outputs from processing are located on the cluster at `/krummellab/data1/nicholascarey/mouse_liver`.
